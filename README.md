# giphy-search
This simple React app provides a UI for searching gifs using an API from https://giphy.com/. It was built in November 2021 as part of a [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) course on Data Fetching in React.
It uses [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) for the XHR request and [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to deploy to GitHub pages.

This is not intended to be a robust app and uses only a beta API key from https://giphy.com/. If you only get a "Loading..." graphic, the API key has likely expired.
